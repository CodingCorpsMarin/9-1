We’ll use online resources for this walkthrough because they’ll have better/more workable databases to play with. For now, let’s go through the syntax for JOIN TABLES.

INNER JOIN

SELECT [column1], [column2], … (this is the information you are trying to query)
FROM [first table]
INNER JOIN [second table]
ON [left table element.id = right table element_id] (this is where primary keys come into play)
WHERE [conditions]

LEFT (outer) JOIN (works for all outer joins)

SELECT [column1], [column2], …
FROM [first table]
LEFT JOIN [second table]
ON [left table element = right table element]
WHERE [conditions]

Databases aren’t always going to just one table, in fact, they almost never are
When you have data that references something in another table, you can call that data using a join table
Many types of joins, INNER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, LEFT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, etc
Tables that share data about a particular element need “primary keys” to identify it across the database
Typically, one table has a column that references an id of the other table’ primary key
INNER JOIN matches rows from 1st table and 2nd table that have the same key. (INNER JOIN is sometimes written as JOIN)
LEFT JOIN, similar syntax to INNER JOIN. Basically displays all the results from the “left” table along with any matching results from the “right” table
LEFT table is the table listed first in your query, RIGHT table is the table listed second
RIGHT JOIN is the same idea, will display all results from “right” table as well as any matching results from the “left” table
OUTER JOIN just basically prints out everything from both tables
Typically, people only really use LEFT JOIN since RIGHT JOIN is the same thing but arranged differently
Results print out in a new table
